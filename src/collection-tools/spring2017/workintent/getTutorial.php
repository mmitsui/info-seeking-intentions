    <h2>Welcome to the Search Intentions User Study!</h2>

    <p>Once you have downloaded and installed the browser plugin for this study, it can be used to automatically record your daily browsing and searching activities in your Chrome browser. By default, it is turned off, but you may click the plugin to activate it and start recording. You may also click &ldquo;Log Out&rdquo; to stop recording. You are asked to annotate your activity for every day of the study. To do this, click the Chrome extension to annotate the day&rsquo;s activities.</p>

    <p>The annotation is divided into 4 main phases. Each phase is outlined below:</p>

    <p><strong><u>Delete Private Items</u></strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Select any pages that you wish to permanently delete from the log. To do so, check their respective boxes in &ldquo;Send Private Items to Trash&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Send to Trash&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>To undo deletion, select them in the &ldquo;Trash Bin&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Undo Delete&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>To confirm the deletion of these pages, select them in the &ldquo;Trash Bin&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Permanently Delete&rdquo;.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><u>Identify Sessions</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Here, you are asked to identify the beginning and end of a search session.</li>
        <li>A search session is defined as a sequence of related activities - i.e., activities related to finding information for a specific task.</li>
        <li>Most search sessions begin with a query to some search system and end when you've completed the activities related to that task.</li>
        <li>Some search sessions don't begin with queries - for instance, when you begin by going to a specific URL. In such cases, the session begins when you arrive at that URL.</li>


        <li>To identify the beginning of a search session, click the &ldquo;Begin&rdquo; button for the page/query that indicates the beginning of the session.</li>
        <li>To identify the end of a search session, click the &ldquo;End&rdquo; button for the page/query that indicates the end of the session.</li>
        <li><u><strong>Multi-tasking</strong></u>
            You may sometimes find you have multiple unrelated search sessions interleaved with each other, for instance when searching in multiple tabs. That's okay.
            Here is how you can mark those sessions:
            <ul>
                <li>Click "Begin" at the beginning of the first session.</li>
                <li>Click "Begin" for the beginning of the next session.</li>
                <li>You will see text next to the "Begin" and "End" buttons indicating which pages and queries are designated to which sessions.</li>
                <li>
                    Click "Begin" any time a new session begins.  You will eventually be asked whether this is the beginning of a previous session (e.g. Session 1 or 2), or whether this is
                    the beginning of a new session.  Please select accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a session has completed entirely, click "End".  You may be prompted which session is ending (e.g. Session 1 or 2).  Please make a selection.
                </li>
            </ul>
            You may sometimes find you have an unrelated search session embedded within a search session you have already identified, for instance when searching in two tabs.
            That's okay.  Mark the beginning and end of that second session and then go back to the first.
        </li>
        <li>To confirm your selection, click &ldquo;Identify Session&rdquo; at the bottom-left of the page.</li>
        <li>To partially undo your selection(s), click "Undo Begin" and "Undo End" where appropriate.</li>
        <li>To undo your selection(s) entirely, click "Cancel" at the bottom-left of the page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><u>Assign Tasks to Sessions</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Next, you must assign tasks to sessions.</li>
        <li><u><strong>What is a task?</strong></u> - Tasks are the things you are trying to accomplish in your work role. You identified some of your tasks in the pre-study interview, and you will see them listed.  You may also create new ones.</li>
        <li>Some of the listed tasks are ones we asked you about in the pre-study interview. You may also create new ones in the right-hand panel &ldquo;2) Click to Assign a Task&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Multiple sessions may belong to the same task. This is fine.</li>
        <li>To assign a task to a session, click the checkbox next to it.</li>
        <li>For the marked session, choose a task by clicking the name of the respective task on the right-hand side.</li>
        <li>If you need to add a task, navigate to the panel that says "Click to Assign a Task". At the bottom, you may specify some new task in the text box and click "+ Add Task"</li>
<!--        //    <ul>-->
<!--            //<li>Click an existing task from the provided options</li>-->
<!--            //<li>Create a new task in the bottom of the panel &ldquo;2) Click to Assign a Task&rdquo;. After naming a new task, click &ldquo;+ Add Task&rdquo;</li>-->
<!--            //</ul>-->
<!--        //</li>-->
    </ul>


    <p><u><strong>Annotate Search Segments and Intentions</strong></u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Next you must assign intentions to each search segment.</li>
        <li>
            <u><strong>What is a search segment?</strong></u> - A search segment a set of related activities
            associated with one goal within a search session.
            A typical search segment begins with a query to a search engine and ends with the next query.
            Such search segments are automatically marked by our system.
        </li>
<!--        <li>You may find that <strong>some search sessions don't have queries</strong>, for instance when you go directly to a new URL. In such cases, a search segment is defined as ending when you change what you're trying to do within the search session.-->
<!--            Often, search sessions have only one search segment.</li>-->
<!--        <li>You may find that some search segments are automatically marked by our system.</li>-->

        <li>You may find that in some sessions without queries, there are nevertheless search segments.  These you will need to mark manually using the begin and end buttons as in marking search sessions.</li>
        <li>Many search sessions have only one segment, but many others will have several.</li>
<!--        <li>The system automatically marks some search segments, but you may need to mark other search segments within sessions. Recall that each session is composed of one or more search segments pertaining to the same task.-->
<!--            <ul>-->
<!---->
<!--                <li>Some of the annotation may be automatically done. Other search segments may need to be assigned manually.</li>-->
<!--                <li>Assignment of the beginning and end of search segments works similarly to the &ldquo;Begin&rdquo; and &ldquo;End&rdquo; annotation for marking sessions.</li>-->
<!--            </ul>-->
<!--        </li>-->
<!--        <li>Assignment of the beginning and end of search segments works similarly to the &ldquo;Begin&rdquo; and &ldquo;End&rdquo; annotation for marking sessions.</li>-->


        <li>After marking a search segment, you will be prompted to mark the intentions for that search segment.
            <ul>
                <li>You <strong>must</strong> choose one or more search intentions, which indicate what you were trying to accomplish during this search segment.</li>
                <li>The elicitation question is: <strong>What were you trying to accomplish (what was your intention) during this part of the search? Please choose one or more of the "search intentions" below; if none fits your goal at this point in the search, please choose "Other", and give a brief explanation.</strong></li>

                <li>For each identified search intention, you are asked:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"<strong>Were you successful?</strong>" You <strong>must</strong> answer either "Yes" or "No".</li>
                        <li>If "No", you <strong>must</strong> respond, in a text entry box, to the question: "<strong>Why not?</strong>"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p><u><strong>Search Session Questionnaire</strong></u></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Next you must determine the success and usefulness of each search session with respect to accomplishing your task goal.</li>

        <li> For each session:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You will be asked 2 questions: "Was the search session successful?" and "How useful was this search session in accomplishing its goal?"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please rate each session on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1="Not at all", 4="Moderately", and 7="Completely".
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you answer either of these questions with a score of 4 or below, you will be asked to explain your reasoning.
                    Please answer as accurately as possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
